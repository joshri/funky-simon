# WELCOME TO FUNKY SIMON!
## The Simon you know and love - but FUNKY.

## Tools:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript 
- VSCode
- GarageBand
- Audacity
- Animate.css animation library
- favicon.io for fav icon
- funk

## Method:
#### I started by chopping up the game functionality into four pieces:
- Computer Chooses (funkyChoice)
- Computer Displays (funkyDisplay)
- Player Chooses (playerInput)
- Win or Lose States (winState, lose, and DefeatState)

#### A couple highlights in my journey to create the MVP:
- global n checker variable to compare player choice to computer choice at every index, so the player will know right away if they lose.
- recursive function to control initial pulse styling on funkyDisplay (later made irrelevant by animate.css, but I wanted to leave it in because it's fun! Especially with the setTimeouts)
- Linking the pieces together: play() triggers computer action, which toggles playerInput, which judges win and loss, which reset to start.

#### Where things got complicated was adding the sound and styling. Highlights here:

- Learning as I went along - going from hard-coding the background animations with css to using an animation api for playerStyle().
- Using Date.now() to add a rhythm game on top of my Simon game. Once I had the song in place I just couldn't help myself. 
- Custom audio done in garageband and audacity from a professional actor! (It was me).

## Known bugs/future fixes:
### Bugs:
- Animations/audio can sometimes be out of sync due to the browser loading speed(?)
- the way rhythm checker increments each beat is based on player input, which can lead to an early or late trigger over time that is unfair
### Fixes:
- Balance audio levels in-game across the board. 
- Better styling on soundboard, and add more clips?
- soundboard clips should be able to cut themselves off to play again.
- Refactor animations and audio into a massive object called Style to make actual game code easier to read. 

If you haven't listened to the lyrics to Funky Simon...just skip ahead in the song and enjoy.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals
- as a player, I want a clear way to trigger the game to start
(title screen and play button)
- as a player, I want to know how many rounds I have completed, and my highest round score of all time!
(current round and high score)
- as a player, I need to be able to tell the difference between buttons, and which button Funky Simon is pressing
(colored buttons, brief highlight when pressed? Paired with keystroke for access?)
- as a player, I want the challenge to increase as I continue to clear rounds, with variety if I want to keep playing after I inevitably lose.
(add one randomized button/round)
- as a player, I want to feel the sting of defeat, with a quick way to jump back in!
(defeat state and replay button)

#### Stretch Goals
- as a player, wouldn't it be nice if Funky Simon were actually funky?
(animations? transitions?)
- as a player, the theme of Funky Simon is begging for an auditory component.
(AUDIO: pairing brief sound clips to button press with text to match, potentially setting the whole thing to rhythm?!?!?!?!?!)
- as an experienced Simon player, I'm looking for something different, be it more challenge or something unique.
(different speed levels? Increased button amount? Simon soundboard freeplay?)
